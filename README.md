# Claps Health Data Sharing Protocol
## Introduction
Claps Health Data Sharing Protocol (Data Authorize Control) is a proof of concept for a secure and decentralized protocol for managing health data consent, access control, and auditing. The protocol is designed to enable individuals to securely share their health data with trusted parties, such as healthcare providers, researchers, or family members, without compromising their privacy or control over their data.

This proof of concept demonstrates the basic functionality of the Claps Health Data Sharing Protocol for Data Authorize Control, including data consent management, one-to-many data sharing, access control, and auditing.

## Features
The Claps Health Data Sharing Protocol (Data Authorize Control) provides the following features:

. Data consent management, allowing users to sign messages or transactions to agree with data sharing by their private key
. One-to-many data sharing, allowing users to engage with multiple patient groups, health practitioners, or healthcare service providers, and share data with many parties
. Access control, allowing users to add trust lists for data sharing, enhancing security by preventing attacks or cheating
. Auditing, allowing parties such as researchers to audit data for AI training, authentic data checks, and compliance with regulations

## Limitations and Future Development
This proof of concept has the following limitations:

The current proof of concept for Claps Health Data Sharing Protocol (Data Authorize Control) does not include data sharing encryption/decryption. Future development for this protocol could include the addition of data sharing encryption/decryption using the ECIES end-to-end data encryption to secure NOT-ON-CHAIN health data. Or other secure encryption methods.
